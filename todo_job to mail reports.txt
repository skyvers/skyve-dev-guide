two different methods - one generates a MailAttachment from a byte[] - but there's a method somewhere - just looking
1:09
			JasperPrint jp = EXT.runSQLReport(user, document, "InvoiceMaster", parameters, ReportFormat.pdf, out);
			pages = jp.getPages().size();
1:10
where out is a ByteArrayOutputStream
1:11
you can put MailAttachments into the the CommunicationUtil methods for sending emails
1:12
there's also a
EXT.runBeanReport(user, document, reportName, parameters, bean, format, out)
