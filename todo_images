Well yep
There is dynamic image
But a contentImage can be made not editable too
Then there is not picker (edited) 
ben 3:28 PM
ok cool
mike 3:29 PM
There is also StaticImage which resolves through the Skyve resources shit
ben 3:30 PM
yeah i meant one which took a binding for showing a full size image (not thumbnail), so that would be a non-editable contentImage i guess
mike 3:30 PM
Nah that shows a thumbnail
You can open the image in a new tab by clicking on it I think
Definitely in contentLink you can
Same with content columns in grids
ben 3:33 PM
i was just thinking of a use case with something like the DKB maybe, where an admin user can go in and set the image for a record, but they want everyone else to see the full image without having to specify the size attributes from the resource servlet in a blurb which is what it's doing now i think

or you might only pick on create, but never change it on edit so don't need to see the picker again, you would delete since the image basically is synonymous with the record
mike 3:35 PM
Yeah - contentImage editable should do the trick
ben 3:36 PM
didn't you say above that shows a thumbnail?

mike 3:37 PM
Yep of at least 100x100
but whatever size you want
rbb555 3:38 PM
or show the image in a blurb @ben
mike 3:39 PM
If you dont give the size parameters it’ll be the original image size

Not sure you’d ever want that though coz it could blow out your UI

mike 3:43 PM
the rotate is a bit weird as well, it rotates within the aspect ratio of the original rotation, so it crops if the image isn’t square
i think we need to use the crop icon too, this UI is pretty confusing
(edited)

So defaults to 100x100 now
The rotate is built in
You know the image can zoom in and out using wheel or slider yes?
Tell me how the UI should be?

i'm trying to think how someone would do this in low code in studio, that's a pretty crap out of the box way to show an image?

zoom in and out where, on the upload screen? which screen have we been talking about?
mike 3:46 PM
contentImage with editable false?
mike 4:02 PM
Yeah the ecommerce thing could be a good idea

Thanks @ben
Remember I’m using the PF upload control at the top
I;ve got no control over that
