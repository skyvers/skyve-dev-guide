Powershell: rename all generatedEdit to edit
Get-ChildItem -Filter "*generatedEdit*" -Recurse | Rename-Item -NewName {$_.name -replace 'generatedEdit','edit' }

Binder.convertAndSet(r, k, c.get(k));

---------------
how to record times in local time 
you need to change the dockerfile for the project and push it
update Dockerfile in the docker/h2 directory
you need to add two lines:
RUN apk add --no-cache tzdata
and
    TZ="Australia/ACT"
or whatever the timezone name is for Sydney, which will be the same as ACT anyway


------
ACTION to go to a create view

 in PF you can do a redirect - but there won't be any context- so no way to go back

```java	
	@Override
	public ServerSideActionResult<MyDocument> execute(MyDocument bean,WebContext webContext) throws Exception {
		FacesUtil.jsRedirect(<whateverURLYouLike>);
		return new ServerSideActionResult<>(bean);
	}
```	

and the URL could be to the create view, like

```java
Util.getSkyveContextUrl() + "?a=e&d=" + MyDocument.DOCUMENT_NAME + "&m=" + m=MyDocument.MODULE_NAME
```
If you have a document with a create view declared, then navigate to the URL without a specified bizId, you'll get a new record and a create view (edited) 


Serializable
I am planning a small big change.
1:19
I am planning to remove the Serialization interface from the MetaData interface.
1:19
This will means that all Skyve metadata wont be Serializable (edited) 
1:20
It was fine until eclipse by default started asking for seriaizable Ids on every class.
1:21
And given the latest round of repository rework, it seems that any remote skyve repository would remote at the data level - ie XML or database or whatever
1:21
and we can now write repositories that interpret that source data instead.
1:22
Also, Serialization has gotten a bad rap mostly because of its ability to remote class load. This has been exploited multiple times in the past.
1:22
I can imagine devs writing a Bizlet going, why is this Serializable?
1:22
So its a small change.

sounds reasonable

mike  1:23 PM
But it has wide impact

rbb555  1:23 PM
yep

mike  1:23 PM
Does anyone have any objections?

rbb555  1:23 PM
surely if you use the security buzz word, no one can have any objections...? :wink: (edited)

@Will Tam will be doing the work as part of Skyve upgrade

Its really a bit of PR because the generated beans are all Serializable and need to remain so to be cached and participate in EJB and other remoting operations.

rbb555  1:26 PM
could you maybe write a paragraph of that I can put into the dev guide please
1:27
otherwise I'll scrape the above

It means if you take 8.1.0-SNAPSHOT you’ll get a bunch of yellow marks prompting you to delete serialVersionUID
