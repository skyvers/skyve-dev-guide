how to record times in local time 
you need to change the dockerfile for the project and push it
update Dockerfile in the docker/h2 directory
you need to add two lines:
RUN apk add --no-cache tzdata
and
    TZ="Australia/ACT"
or whatever the timezone name is for Sydney, which will be the same as ACT anyway

ACTION to go to a create view

 in PF you can do a redirect - but there won't be any context- so no way to go back

```java	
	@Override
	public ServerSideActionResult<MyDocument> execute(MyDocument bean,WebContext webContext) throws Exception {
		FacesUtil.jsRedirect(<whateverURLYouLike>);
		return new ServerSideActionResult<>(bean);
	}
```	

and the URL could be to the create view, like

```java
Util.getSkyveContextUrl() + "?a=e&d=" + MyDocument.DOCUMENT_NAME + "&m=" + m=MyDocument.MODULE_NAME
```
If you have a document with a create view declared, then navigate to the URL without a specified bizId, you'll get a new record and a create view (edited)
