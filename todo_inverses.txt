so these are the opposite of association and collection

when you need to point back in the other direction
11:32
so for example, in the CTP application i will get you to work on soon, we have an Accident table with an association to AccidentDetails
11:32
accident is just a root table, doesn’t really have any information on it’s own

ben  11:33
so in a list menu from a module query, for accident we can show accidentDetails.accidentNumber in a binding, because accident has an association to AccidentDetails, make sense?

Afshin  11:33
yeah

ben  11:34
but if we wanted to include an attribute from Accident in an AccidentDetails query, we can’t, because there is no relationship/binding in Accident details back to accident
11:34
so we can create an inverseOne on accident details pointing to accident

Afshin  11:35
Thanks @ben.

ben  11:36
does that make sense? then accident binding becomes available in views and queries for AccidentDetail
11:36
inverseMany is the same thing, but when there is more than one, so if there is a collection
