Between browser and server is TLS.
If it is all on the same machine and H2 then it is via the same Java process so no transmission.
All other databases are via JDBC and have various options to turn on TLS.
Content Management defaults to in-process as well - no transmission, but there are options for JDBC, EJB or REST. EJB & REST can be configured for TLS.
Where we have multiple machines communicating in an application we use SOAP, EJB, REST etc with the normal encryption options available with these remoting mechanisms.
