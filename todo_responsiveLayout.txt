I’ve completed the work getting responsive layout on primeflex.
So remember it’s controlled in the web.xml and should be on by default now.
I’ve added vertical and horizontal alignment and fixed pixel layouts controlled by pixelWidth to vbox and hbox.
Ive also added “sm”, “md”, “lg” & “xl” responsive widths and view widget size
validation.
If you wanna override the standard conversions skyve does to determine responsive widths these attributes can be used.
sm = small
md = medium
lg = large
xl = extra large
The breakpoints are different for PF responsive grid and prime flex
ui-sm-* Phones max-width: 40em (640px) ui-sm-6, ui-sm-4
ui-md-* Tablets min-width: 40.063em (641px) ui-md-2, ui-sm-8
ui-lg-* Desktops min-width: 64.063em (1025px) ui-lg-6, ui-sm-12
ui-xl-* Big screen monitors min-width: 90.063em (1441px) ui-xl-2, ui-sm-10
versus primeflex
p-sm-* : min-width 576px
p-md-* : min-width 768px
p-lg-* : min-width 992px
p-xl-* : min-width 1200px
It is now possible to easily centre on very large screens with a combo of horizontalAlignment=“centre” and xl=“9" for instance to take up the middle 3/4 of the page
and it should be easier to get widget sizes finessed.
