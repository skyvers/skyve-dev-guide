POLYMORPHIC
can you remind me what `polymorphic` is for on queries?

polymorphic returns the bean in the MapBean as "THIS"

This means the bean itself can be used to get properties

It is automatically turned on when a query has a driving document that is somewhere is a hiearachy or if a column is required that has dynamic domain values.

the polymorhpic attribute overrides the default behaviour

polymorphic is used when you are returning results for a document, but that result set contains subtypes. this was introduced for the config engine occurrences. so we had an occurrence query, but when you zoomed, it loaded the correct edit view based on the biz discriminator

rbb555 [11:14 AM]
so polymorphic is for using bizDiscriminator, but if you use joined strategy then you get the same effect and don't need to set polymorphic? (as we did in FSP) (edited) 

ben [11:15 AM]
@rbb555 that image thing is why i had to create a separate dashboard for PF for DKB

rbb555 [11:15 AM]
ah- ok

ben [11:15 AM]
yeah something to do with that, i think setting polymorphic forces return of the bizDiscriminator?


PUSH
I redid push using omnifaces (like @cameronw used in foundry).

use in a job like this
    ```@Override
    public void execute() throws Exception {
        push(newPushMessage().growl(MessageSeverity.info, "wee"));
    }```
and in WebContext like this
    ```@Override
    public ServerSideActionResult<ChangePassword> execute(ChangePassword bean, WebContext webContext) throws Exception {
        Map<String, Object> argument = new TreeMap<>();
        argument.put("POOP", "SHITE");
        webContext.push(webContext.newPushMessage()
                            .growl(MessageSeverity.fatal, "POOP")
                            .growl(MessageSeverity.info, "WEE")
                            .message(MessageSeverity.error,  "BUNM")
                            .message(MessageSeverity.info, "COCK")
                            .rerender()
                            .execute("alert", argument));```
there are 4 types of push that can be chained in order
growl, message, rerender and execute
rerender is like the event action
execute allows execution of a javascript function (from window)
argument is a single argument js object (JSON)
If you build the push message for the current user with the user() method, it will go to the current user otherwise its a broadcast message to everyone
```
        webContext.push(webContext.newPushMessage()
                            .user()
                            .growl(MessageSeverity.fatal, "POOP")
```							
So there is no dependency on atmnosphere any more since PF push is deprecated and 7 is about to land where it is removed
