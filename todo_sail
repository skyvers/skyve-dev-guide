Download SAIL runner from http://bizhub.com.au/public/sail.zip
Unzip
test run (should show foundry page)
Generate a jar from Control panel
place in the sail runner folder

Up to you guys - I guess it really was a shortcut for people editing by hand
Cant hurt to stay as parsimonious as possible :wink:

So, I've pushed the SAIL client thing
There is an ant target called sailAssemble in skyve-build.xml
That will create a sail.zip in /skyve-ee
Unzip that and either run the sail.sh or sail.bat or sail.exe and you should see chrome start up and point to foundry prod landing page
If you go into control panel, create some SAIL, use the web driver, press execute as usual, you should see the normal JUnit code.
Now if you press download, you'll get a sail.jar,
replace sail.jar in the sail folder you unzipped and run your tests
(hopefully)
I put some extra fields on the SAIL UI - baseURL, Login customer & Login password
The Generator now generates login and logout op-codes
but only if you specify a password
Also, I;ve added RuntimeCompiler to skyve
You can compile from a source folder to a class folder
You can compile a java string (or Iterable of Strings) to a class folder
You can compile an Iterable of java code Strings and receive a ClassLoader to load your classes from backed by Map of in-memory byte code

@rbb555, maybe you could have a crack at creating a download option foundry

The sailAssemble creates a compile folder under the content directory that has jars in it.
