Interface org.skyve.metadata.controller.Observer created.
At the moment it has startup and shutdown callbacks on it but could add other methods if they come up.
Skyve services implement Observer to initialise and finalise themselves.
AddInManager
Caching
ContentManager
JobScheduler
Reporting
Application level Observer implementations are Registered through customer xml similar to interceptors.

The order they are defined are the order they are called so you can create dependencies.
Shutdown is called in the reverse order (similar to interceptors)
