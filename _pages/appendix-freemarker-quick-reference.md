### Testing for nulls
By default, Freemarker will throw an exception if an object being printed to the report is null unless it is handled. This can be done with an `if` check, or using the null check.

A double question mark is used within an if statement to check that the value is not null, e.g. 
```
<#if userName??>
   Hi ${userName}, How are you?
</#if>
```

This checks if the attribute of the object is not null:
`<#if object.attribute??></#if>`
This checks if object or attribute is not null (use parentheses):
`<#if (object.attribute)??></#if>`

Alternatively, an exclamation can be used for inline checking:
```
Hi ${userName!}, How are you?
```
This also can be used to provide a default value:
```
Hi ${userName!"John Doe"}, How are you?
```

### If/Else Statements
Basic syntax is 
```
<#if condition>
  ...
<#elseif condition2>
  ...
<#elseif condition3>
  ...
...
<#else>
  ...
</#if>
```
For example:
```
<#if x == 1>
  x is 1
<#else>
  x is not 1
</#if>
```
See [if, else, elseif - Apache FreeMarker Manual](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_if.html)

### Loops/Iterating
Simplest form of a loop syntax is:
```
<#list sequence as item>
    Part repeated for each item
</#list>
```
Using this with a variable, this example looks like: 
```
<#list users as user>
  <p>${user}
</#list>
```
Print something when the list is empty:
```
<#list sequence as item>
    Part repeated for each item
<#else>
    Part executed when there are 0 items
</#list>
```
Do some processing when the list is not empty, before or after you start iterating, e.g. a header row in a table, or a summary row:
```
<#list sequence>
    Part executed once if we have more than 0 items
    <#items as item>
    Part repeated for each item
    </#items>
    Part executed once if we have more than 0 items
<#else>
    Part executed when there are 0 items
</#list>
```
See [list, else, items, sep, break, continue - Apache FreeMarker Manual](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_list.html)

### Assigning variables within a report
Variables can be assigned with the `assign` directive, e.g.
```
<#assign total = 0>
```
These can then be manipulated, .e.g within a loop:
```
 <#assign total += bean.amount>
```
And then just read back out later when they need to be printed
```
${total}
```
See [assign - Apache FreeMarker Manual](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_assign.html)

### Formatting values for display
Freemarker uses the built in Java formatter based on the value type. Sometimes this format is not appropriate, say you have an ID number which is a long, e.g. 123456. In Australia, the default numerical locale will print this as 123,456. To force this into a specific string format, we can specify:
```
${bean.longId?string["######"]}
```

There are also many [built in formatters for dates](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_builtins_date.html), e.g. 
```
${.now?string["dd-MMM-yyyy"]}
```

A format can be specified at the start of a template to be used for the rest of the report, for example
```
<#setting number_format=",##0.00">
```

Skyve also includes some custom Freemarker directives which can be used to use the formatter specified for the customer, e.g. date formatting, based on which dataset you are using.

BizQL or Bean dataset:
```
<@format bean=account binding="openDate" />
```
Note: do not put quotes around the bean, this is expecting an object to be passed through. This can be a compound binding.

SQL dataset:
```
<@sqlformat value=bean.dateCreated />
```

### Including one template in another
A template can import another template with the `include` directive, e.g. 
```
<#include "header.ftlh">
```
The path needs to be something Freemarker can find on the filesystem or in the database.

### Including images
Skyve offers a number of directives to include images, including static images, dynamic images, and images from the Skyve content store.

Examples for static images:

```
<@image filename="logo.png" />
```

```
<@image filename="logo.png" module="admin" alt="Corporate logo" height="60" class="logo" />
``` 
 

Examples for dynamic images:

```
<@dynamicImage bean=bean module="elixan" document="Survey" image="SpiderChart" width=700 height=450 />
```

 * image: The name of the image
 * module: The name of the module which contains the DynamicImage
 * document: The name of the document which contains the DynamicImage
 * bean: The bean which the image belongs to
 * height: Height of the image element, can be null
 * width: Width of the image element, can be null


Examples for images from the content store:

```
<@content bean=content module="admin" document="Contact" attribute="image" />
```

* filename: The name of the resource
* module: The name of the module where the resource is located, can be null
* alt: Alt text for the image element, can be null
* height: Height of the image element, can be null
* width: Width of the image element, can be null
* class: Class(es) for the image element, can be null
* style: Style(s) for the image element, can be null

### Macros
Once you have mastered the basics, macros defined within a template can be useful for repeating rows within tables, etc.
See [macro, nested, return - Apache FreeMarker Manual](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_macro.html)

The `import` directive can also be used to load a file containing re-usable macros but without outputting anything to the template like `include` does.

For example:
```
<#import "/libs/commons.ftl" as com>
<@com.copyright date="1999-2002"/>
```
See [import - Apache FreeMarker Manual](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_import.html#ref.directive.import)

### Newlines
To preserve newlines in the HTML report for Freemarker, e.g. from a memo field in Skyve:
```
<#noautoesc>
	${bean.comments!?replace('\n', '<br/>')}
</#noautoesc>
```

### Macros
It is possible to create macros for re-usable sections of logic  within a template. See [macro, nested, return - Apache FreeMarker Manual](https://freemarker.apache.org/docs/ref_directive_macro.html)

### Worked example - exporting filtered CSV data

The following are the steps for creating a simple filtered CSV export using freemarker. 

This example assumes you have a document called *Invoice* which has attributes *invoiceNumber* (text), *sentDate* (date) and *total* (decimal2) and will produce a CSV export of all the Invoices within a specific date range.

1. Create a transient document for the report filter parameters called InvoiceExport with two attributes, `fromDate` (date) and `toDate` (date)
2. Add a `reports` package to the document package and create a file named `InvoiceExport.ftlh` as follows:

```xml
<#list invoiceExportData>
Invoice Number,Sent Date,Total
	<#items as bean>
<@format bean=bean binding="invoiceNumber" />,<@format bean=bean binding="sentDate" />,<@format bean=bean binding="total" />
	</#items>
<#else>
		No records.
</#list>
```

3. Create an extension class called `InvoiceExportExtension` that extends `InvoiceExport`, and add a method to `InvoiceExportExtension` called generateInvoiceExportDownload() as follows:

```java
public Download generateInvoiceExportDownload() throws Exception {

	String reportName = "InvoiceExport.ftlh"; // by default skyve will look for this file in the reports package of this document
	String reportTitle = "Invoice Data"; 
	Map<String, Object> exportData = new HashMap<>();
	exportData.put("invoiceExportData", this.getReportData());

	String csvFile = EXT.getReporting().createFreemarkerBeanReport(this, reportName, exportData);
	return new Download(String.format("%s.csv", reportTitle), csvFile.getBytes(), MimeType.csv);
}

/**
 * @return - a List of Invoices for the Invoice Data export
 * optionally filtered according to the values set in this bean
 */
public List<Invoice> getReportData() {
	DocumentQuery q = CORE.getPersistence().newDocumentQuery(Invoice.MODULE_NAME, Invoice.DOCUMENT_NAME);
	if (this.getFromDate() != null) {
		q.getFilter().addGreaterThanOrEqualTo(Invoice.sentDatePropertyName, this.getFromDate());
	}
	if (this.getToDate() != null) {
		q.getFilter().addGreaterThanOrEqualTo(Invoice.sentDatePropertyName, this.getToDate());
	}
	return q.beanResults();
}
```

4. Add a download action to the document actions package, the view and add privileges for the document and action in the module, and override the download action as follows:

```java
@Override
public Download download(DataExportsExtension bean, WebContext webContext) throws Exception {
	return bean.generateInvoiceExportDownload();
}
```
